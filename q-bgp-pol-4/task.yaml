    Consider the simple interdomain topology shown below. In this exercise, we will compute the path from ``AS3`` to ``AS1``. For this, we need to build the routing tables of the other ASes in the topology.

            What are the interdomain paths that ``AS2`` has learned to reach the prefix advertised by ``AS1`` ?

            Provide your answer as a comma-separated list of paths starting with the preferred one. For example, the answer::

             AS9:AS1, AS8:AS7:AS1

            indicates that the AS has learned two different paths. The preferred one is the one via ``AS9`` that has a length of 2 AS hops while the second path has a length of 3 AS hops. If there is no path, return 0 as your answer.
