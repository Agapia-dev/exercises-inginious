        name: Reorder the segments

        header: During this connection, the client sent some data that was acknowledged
            by the server. Can you reorder the segments based on their sequence numbers
            and acknowledgements ? The trace starts at the third ack of the three-way
            handshake sent by the client to the server.
        type: network-trace
        trace: tcp-rfc793-26-34.pcap.xml
        shuffle-feedback: Obviously, you need to look at the sequence numbers and
            the acknowledgements. The server listens on port 1234. If you are a bit
            lost, you can look at the data contained in the TCP segments sent by the
            client, their payload could help you...
