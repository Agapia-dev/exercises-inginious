            After having correctly transmitted several frames, a host sends a data frame that is correctly acknowledged. This corresponds to the situation shown in the figure below:

            .. container:: text-center

                .. image:: mcq-rel-abp/figure1.png

            At this stage of the transfer, which of the following proposals is true?

        -   feedback: This example is correct. It could correspond to a scenario where
                the host on the left sent some data until it reached sequence number
                0 and then become idle before sending data `y`.

                This scenario is incorrect. The same sequence number is used incorrectly to send `x` and `y`.

                        This scenario is incorrect. The host on the right should not send `C(OK1)` after having received `D(0,x)`

        -   feedback: This example is incorrect. The second frame is a retransmission
                for the host on the right since it carries the same sequence number.
                It should never delivery the data to its user.

        -   feedback: This example is incorrect. The acknowledgements sent by the
                host on the right are incorrect. When receiving `D(1,d)` and accepting
                it since it issues a `Data.ind(d)`, it should not send `C(OK0)` but
                instead `C(OK1)`.
