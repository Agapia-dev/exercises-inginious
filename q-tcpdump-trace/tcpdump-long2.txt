What happened in this trace

- launched chrome
- launched firefox
- visited github.com
- visited ietf.org
- sent an email
- downloaded email over POP

Chrome seems to send lots of DNS requests for strange reasons

Probably a lot of other background noise in the trace (I cleaned multicast and other stuff)
