            Consider the network below where the red arrows represent customer->provider peerings and the blue lines shared cost peerings. We consider different policies for the green line.

            Provide your answer as a comma-separated list of paths starting with the preferred one. For example, the answer::

             AS9:AS1, AS8:AS7:AS1

            indicates that the AS has learned two different paths. The preferred one is the one via ``AS9`` that has a length of 2 AS hops while the second path has a length of 3 AS hops. If there is no path, return 0 as your answer.

            What are the interdomain paths that ``AS3`` has learned to reach the prefix advertised by ``AS1`` in the network above if ``AS2`` is a shared-cost peer of ``AS3`` ?
