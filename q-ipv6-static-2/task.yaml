    Consider the network shown in the figure below. In this network, the following addresses are used.

      - host ``A`` : ``2001:db8:1341:1::A`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:1::1``
      - host ``B`` : ``2001:db8:1341:4::B`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:4::4``

    The routers have one address inside each network :

     - router ``R1`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:1::1`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:12::1`` on its East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::1`` on its South interface
     - router ``R2`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:12::2`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:23::2`` on its South-West interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:24::2`` on its South interface.
     - router ``R3`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:34::3`` on its East interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:23::3`` on its North-East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::3`` on its North interface
     - router ``R4`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:34::4`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:24::4`` on its North interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:4::4`` on its East interface

    The forwarding paths used in a network depend on the forwarding tables installed in the network nodes. Sometimes, these forwarding tables must be configured manually.
