        -   text: The server returns a status code of 200 which indicates a success.
            valid: true
        -   feedback: The Status Code of the server is 200.
            text: The server returns a status code of 404 which indicates that the
                requested object could not be found.

            feedback: |
                This is incorrect. The URL is composed of two parts. The parameter of the `Host:` line and the parameter of the `GET` request
        -   feedback: The version of HTTP used is the last parameter of the GET request.
            text: The client uses HTTP/1.1
        -   text: The MIME Content-Type of the retrieved web object is `text/html`
            feedback: This is incorrect, check the `Content-Type` line in the HTTP
                response.
        -   text: The response was served by the Apache server
            feedback: This is incorrect, check the `Server` line in the HTTP response.
        -   text: The response returned by the server is 62 bytes long.
            feedback: See the `Content-Length` header in the HTTP response.

            Network engineers often need to capture the packets that are exchanged over a network to debug various types of problems. Here is a `simple packet trace <mcq-http-trace/http-trace.pcap>`_

            Open this packet trace in `wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_ or use `tcpdump <https://www.tcpdump.org>`_ on the command line determine which of the affirmations below are correct.
