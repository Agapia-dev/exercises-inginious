            feedback: Indeed, the query may be found in the fourth packet and the
                response in the sixth one. The other packets of the trace are part
                of the TCP protocol
            text: The packet trace contains one DNS query and one DNS response
        -   text: The packet trace contains 10 DNS messages
            feedback: This is incorrect, most of the packets in the trace are TCP
                packets. Only two DNS messages are exchanged.
        -   valid: true
            text: The query requested an IPv6 address (type `AAAA`)
        -   text: The query requested an alias (type `CNAME`)
            feedback: The response contains a CNAME, but the request was for an `AAAA`
                record.
        -   feedback: This is incorrect, the response contains three records, two
                `CNAME` and one `AAAA`.
            text: The response contains a single `AAAA` record
        -   text: The query was sent to a DNS resolver.
            valid: true
            feedback: This is correct as the `Flags` indicate that the `Recursion
                Desired` flag was set.
        -   feedback: This is  incorrect as the `Flags` indicate that the `Recursion
                Desired` flag was set.
            text: The query was sent to an authoritative DNS server.

            Although DNS is mainly used over UDP, there are some situations where it can be used over TCP as well. The attached `packet trace <mcq-pkt-dns-2/dns-trace-29365.pcap>`_ contains a TCP connection that was used by `dig` to interact with the Domain Name System.

            Download the packet trace and select the affirmations below that are valid.
