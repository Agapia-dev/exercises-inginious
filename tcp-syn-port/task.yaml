        header: The first TCP segment was sent by a client to a server to establish
            a connection. From the response returned by the server, can you infer
            the source and destination ports used in the first segment ?

        feedback:
            tcp.dstport: The Destination Port field is defined in `Section 3.1 of
                RFC793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`_  In the segment sent
                by the client, the Destination Port corresponds to the service that
                is requested on the server. IANA maintains a list of registered port
                numbers at `https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml  <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml>`_
                When the server replies, the Destination Port of the request is copied
                in the Source Port of the response.
            tcp.srcport: The Source Port field is defined in `Section 3.1 of RFC793
                <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`_   It is usually a unique   port
                number that is chosen by the client stack among the unused port numbers.
                Port numbers that are lower than 1024 play a special role and can
                only be assigned by processes that have administrator privileges.
                When the server replies, the Source Port of the request is copied
                in the Destination Port of the response.
