    Consider the simple interdomain network shown below where we will look at the impact of the routing policies on the link between ``AS2`` and ``AS4`` on the paths towards the prefix advertised by ``AS1`` that are received by ``AS3``

            What are the interdomain paths that ``AS3`` has learned to reach the prefix advertised by ``AS1`` in the network below if ``AS2`` is a shared cost peer of ``AS4``?

            Provide your answer as a comma-separated list of paths starting with the preferred one. For example, the answer::

             AS9:AS1, AS8:AS7:AS1

            indicates that the AS has learned two different paths. The preferred one is the one via ``AS9`` that has a length of 2 AS hops while the second path has a length of 3 AS hops. If there is no path, return 0 as your answer.
