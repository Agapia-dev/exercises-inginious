        header: The `attached packet trace <https://inginious.org/course/cnp3/q-pkt-ssh-3/ssh.pcap>`_
            was collected on a Linux server. In the ssh protocol, the client and the
            server can request that data be compressed before encryption. This can
            be useful to speedup transfers in low speed networks. To negotiate the
            compression scheme, the client and the servers propose an ordered list
            in the KeyExchangeInit message.
