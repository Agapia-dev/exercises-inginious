    TCP segments contain flags. These are defined in `Section 3.1 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1>`_ of `RFC793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`_.

    The packet trace below corresponds to the establishment of a TCP connection by a client that sent one byte of data and then decided to close the connection immediately.

        feedback:
            tcp.flags.fin: The `FIN` flag is set in the segment that mark the end
                of the data transfer on the direction where it is sent. Remember that
                the `FIN` flag also consumes one sequence number like the `SYN` one
                and that it is only set once by the client before it is acknowledged
                and then once by the server.
