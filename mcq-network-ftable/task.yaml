            The forwarding paths used in a network depend on the forwarding tables installed in the network nodes. Consider the network shown below with the forwarding tables.

            The forwarding paths used in a network depend on the forwarding tables installed in the network nodes. Sometimes, these forwarding tables are configured manually and an incorrect configuration may cause some paths to be impossible.

            In this network, `A` can send packets to `B`, but when `B` sends a packet to `A`, this packet never reaches its destination. Among the following forwarding tables, which is the one that ensures that `A` can exchange packets with `B` ?
