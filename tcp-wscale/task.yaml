            Assuming that that the client will use on the entire connection the same
            window size that it announced in the `SYN`, can you infer the value of
            the receive window that it will advertise inside its first segments ? '

        feedback:
            tcp.window_size: Remember that the client announces in its SYN segment
                the scaling factor that it will use to announce its windows later.
                With a window scaling of 9, this implies that the actual window (in
                bytes), must be divided by :math:`2^9=512` before sending it in the
                `window` field of the transmitted segments.
