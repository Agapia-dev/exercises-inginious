                The Acknowledgement Number is defined in `Section 3.1 of RFC793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`_   as follows: *If the ACK control bit is set this field contains the value of the
                  next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to
                  receive.  Once a connection is established this is always sent.* Remember that during the three-way-handshake, the transmission of the SYN bit consumes one sequence number.
