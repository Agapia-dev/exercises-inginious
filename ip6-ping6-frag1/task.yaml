    is a companion protocol for IPv6 that is used for various functions including
    network debugging. `ping6` is a popular debugging tool that allows to verify whether
    a remote host is up and running. For this, it sends an ICMPv6 Echo request that
    contains some information and waits for an ICMPv6 Echo reply. We use it to observe
    IPv6 packet fragmentation by sending large ICMPv6 messages.'
